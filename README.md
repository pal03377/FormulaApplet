# H5P Plugin
## General
* There is an H5P plugin for the FormulaApplet with which you can put FormulaApplet tasks on pages with H5p support.
* You need the H5P.FormulaApplet and the H5P.FormulaAppletEditor plugin for this to work.
## H5P Development environment
* In the h5p folder there is a Docker environment for a Drupal instance with H5P installed on which you can test the plugin.
* First-time installation for the Docker development environment:
  1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and Docker Compose (might be included with docker).
  1. Run the following command in the `h5p` directory: `docker compose build` (might take a while), then `docker compose up`. If `docker compose` is not available, use `docker-compose`.
  1. Open http://localhost:8080. Start the setup for Drupal. If you need account credentials, use username `admin` with password `admin`. 
  1. Follow [the steps to set up H5P development](https://h5p.org/development-environment-docker#:~:text=Enabling%20H5P%20development%20mode%20and%20development%20folder) (under "Enabling H5P development mode and development folder").
  1. Now start the JavaScript Bundler (Rollup) build in H5P development mode by running `npm run h5p` in the `main` folder. This will automatically build the plugin scripts, copy them into the plugin development folders and should auto-refresh the Drupal page when code is changed.
  1. Now "create content" in Drupal and choose the FormulaApplet plugin.
